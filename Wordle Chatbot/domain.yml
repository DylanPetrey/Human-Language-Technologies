          \nYour guess can be any 5-letter word. I will tell you how each character related to the target word.
          \nIf any letter is highlighted in yellow, that means that the letter is hidden in the word. 
          \nIf any letter is highlighted green, then that letter is in the correct location. 
          \nIf the letter is highlighted red, that letter is not in the target."
