29 July 2008In a meeting at Ferrari's Maranello base which is attended by Bernie Ecclestone, the teams agree to form a new association. The Formula One Teams Association (Fota) will work with the FIA and Formula One Management to come up with a new Concorde Agreement.11 September 2008Fota is officially launched, with the Ferrari president, Luca di Montezemolo, named as first chairman and the Toyota president, John Howett, as vice-chairman. Three separate commissions are set up to look at sporting, technical and commercial rules.21 October 2008The FIA president, Max Mosley, meets Di Montezemolo and Howett in Geneva and agrees that the sport must make dramatic cost cuts.4 December 2008Fota finalises its plans for cost-cutting measures and engine rules, having been asked by the FIA to make proposals. Fota also raises the issue of teams receiving a greater share of the sport's profits – an aspect backed by the FIA as it bids to secure the future of the smaller teams.10 December 2008The FIA and Fota agree a series of cost-cutting measures, their Monaco meeting being hailed as "the most successful meeting on formula one matters which any of the participants can remember".12 December 2008The World Motor Sport Council (WMSC) rubber-stamps the measures, which include a ban on in-season testing, a reduction in aerodynamic development and the doubling of engine life from 2009.5 January 2009Mosley writes to Fota asking the teams to make sure these rules – which the teams believe will mean budgets cut by 50% – are implemented ahead of a Fota meeting.5 March 2009Di Montezemolo says teams are ready to sign a new Concorde Agreement until end of 2012, but Fota calls for an immediate change to points system.17 March 2009The WMSC announces technical regulations for 2010 that will force teams to either adhere to a £30m budget cap and have technical freedom, or run with the current regulations and with financial freedom. It also rejects Fota's points proposal and says the 2009 champion will be the driver with most race wins.27 March 2009Fota hits out at the new rules, which it says would create a two-tier system, but claims it is not opposed to a budget cap.6 May 2009Following strained relations caused by the diffuser row in the opening grands prix, Fota meets to secure its unity and requests urgent talks with the FIA on the 2010 rule changes.9 May 2009Toyota, followed by Ferrari, Renault and Red Bull, say they will not enter the 2010 championship unless changes are made to the two-tier budget cap system.15 May 2009Fota meets Mosley and Ecclestone but the parties fail to reach an agreement over the budget cap.19 May 2009Ferrari attempts to gain an injunction against the FIA's regulations through the French courts, but it is rejected.25 May 2009Williams breaks the ranks by lodging an unconditional application for 2010 entry and is subsequently suspended by Fota.29 May 2009The remaining current teams submit entries on the condition that the regulations are based on 2009 rules that are "identical for all competitors and amended in accordance with proposals Fota has submitted to the FIA".5 June 2009Force India announces that its entry is unconditional and is expelled by Fota; the remaining eight teams meet their drivers two days later and receive their support in attempt to scrap the budget cap.12 June 2009FIA publishes 2010 entry list, in which it says Red Bull, Toro Rosso and Ferrari have unconditional entries, while the remaining five Fota teams are asked to drop their conditions if they are to race.15 June 2009Financial representatives from the FIA and Fota fail to reach an agreement, the FIA saying its plans for a £40m budget cap will go ahead and later accusing Fota of trying to take over the regulation of formula one.18 June 2009A day ahead of the deadline for unconditionally entering the 2010 championship, Fota announces it is to set up a breakaway series; the FIA responds by saying it cannot permit "a financial arms race in the championship".24 June 2009The FIA and Fota agree there will be no parallel championship next season following talks in Paris to avert the threatened breakaway. As a result of the peace deal, Max Mosley says he will not seek to extend his time in office.
