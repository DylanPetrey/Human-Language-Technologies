# Human-Language-Technologies
This is my portfolio for CS 4395.001 at UT Dallas


## Overview of NLP
This is my first assignment for the class. It required me to answer questions based on NLP

My responses are [here](https://github.com/DylanPetrey/Human-Language-Technologies/blob/main/Overview%20of%20NLP/homework0_mdp180000.pdf) and the assignment description is [here](https://github.com/DylanPetrey/Human-Language-Technologies/blob/main/Overview%20of%20NLP/Portfolio%20Component%200.pdf)


## Text Processing with Python
### Overview
This assignment reads in a CSV file and verifies that all of the data is uniform. If an entry does not follow the standard, then it will prompt the user to enter a new entry until it is follows the set standard.

### Instructions
To run this program, run the python file with the location of the data.csv in the argument.

### Text Processing
A major strength that I found in using python is that it is much simplier to process text than in other languages. A weakness would be the speed at runtime.

### What I learned
In this assignment I learned about applying regrex in a program. In the past I had to create it for Automata Theory, however, we need not actually use it in a program.
